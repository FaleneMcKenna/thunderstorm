#### Suggestions:
- [params.sh](dev-tools/scripts/dev/typescript/params.sh): I propose a different logic. For example, `git commit -am"foo"` has two commands: `all` and `message` (which also has a param).
- `--tmux`: this parameter passed to build_and_install (or in `package.json`?) would - instead of opening things in the background - open a tmux session with split windows.
