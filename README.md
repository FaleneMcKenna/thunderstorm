# Typescript & React - Frontend & Backend

This boilerplate is a unification of both frontend and backend in one repo.. 

blah blah blah...

## A word about boilerplate...

I think this entire concept suck... it is problematic! there are literally hundreds of examples out there
each looks completely different than the other and just getting started can be the worst pain in the butt not
to mention staying up to date with latest versions of infra components!!

SO... I debated this question for three days and I think that the best way to keep up to date with a boilerplate 
is to actually fork a boilerplate repo and get (merge/rebase) the latest updates whenever you can/want... but 
all these online gits services (github, bitbucket, ...) do not allow you to fork a public repo privately and then 
companies and individuals that want to use it in their private repo need to Google how to do that and how to merge 
the latest changes in order to stay up to date.

This boilerplate saves you that headache.. 

**NOTE:**
You don't need to stick with the architecture I choose, you can do whatever the hell you want... but it is always 
easier to change a working example then to bash your head when things never worked before.

# Getting Started

 * First and foremost you need [**bash** (4.4 and higher)](https://www.google.com/search?q=how+to+install+bash) if you don't have it.. please grow up and get it..
 * You would need to install [**npm** (6.4.1) and **node** (8.15.0)](https://www.google.com/search?q=how+to+install+node+and+npm)

### <a name="getthingsgoing"/>If you just want to get things going:
```bash
git clone --recursive git@github.com:nu-art-js/typescript-boilerplate.git my-project
cd my-project
bash build-and-install.sh --set-env=dev --setup --launch-frontend --launch-backend
```


### If you want to work like a pro (use libraries sources):

```bash
git clone --recursive git@github.com:nu-art-js/typescript-boilerplate.git my-project
cd my-project
bash build-and-install.sh --nu-art --set-env=dev --setup --launch-frontend --launch-backend
```

(unless I have made a stupid mistake.. these should always be aligned and compiling together with this repo!!)
 
### To fork this repo to your private (or public) repo: 
 * Prepare an empty repo and acquire the repo remote tracking url `(e.g. git@github.com:${username}/${my-project}.git)`
 * Clone this repo locally `git clone --recursive git@github.com:nu-art-js/typescript-boilerplate.git my-project && cd my-project`
 * Then run from within this cloned repo: `bash ./dev-tools/git/git-fork.sh --to=git@github.com:${username}/${my-project}.git --output=../my-project`
 * and you are ready to go...


### To merge latest changes from this repo onto your forked repo run: (in your cloned repo)
```bash
bash build-and-install.sh --merge-origin
```

# Environment

Both frontend and backend needs to have the same environment to work.. for various reasons.

Right after you've cloned the repo you will see:
 * In the frontend you can see two files `config-dev.ts` *(not ignored)* and `config-prod.ts` *(not ignored)*
 * In the backend you can see only `.example-config.json` *(not ignored)* file
 
After you would run `bash build-and-install.sh --set-env=dev` for the first time you will see:
 * In the frontend you can see same two files as before, and a new `config.ts` *(ignored)*
 * In the backend the `.example-config.json` would be deleted, and you'd see these new files:
  `.config.json`, `.config-dev.json`, `.config-prod.json` and `.runtimeconfig.json` (all ignored)

There is no point in editing the `.config.json` or the `config.ts`, you SHOULD only edit the dev and prod files and 
running `bash build-and-install.sh --set-env=dev` would override the `.config.json` or the `config.ts` with the 
content of the dev config respectively.

**NOTE:** This repo comes with *dev* and *prod*(sort of) env built in, you can add as many environments as you'd like just follow
the file name pattern. Keep in mind though that some of your backend configuration would contain sensitive data therefor should not
be added to your git repo!!

**NOTE:** Because this boilerplate uses firebase functions, and firebase functions config is stupidly limited and annoying to set.. 
the solution I came up with to avoid the hustle is that the backend `config.json` would be encoded into base64 string, set as one
entry to firebase then decoded and use at runtime, this is what the `.runtimeconfig.json` file is for.

# Setting up

 * In order to start using the repo you would need to run `npm install` on each of the repos.. whether you use the library sources or not:
`bash build-and-install.sh --setup` will do the trick.
 * You would need to setup which environment to runs... to use *dev* environment run: `bash build-and-install.sh --set-env=dev`

**NOTE:** You can replace *dev* with anything you'd like... just need to make sure the config files are there to back it up
 
 
# Running

To run the frontend and backend respectively run:
`bash build-and-install.sh --launch-frontend --launch-backend`

**NOTE:** you can run each individually

# Deploying

While personally I would prefer to pay for a dedicated server and manage my own server resources and runtime, 
for the sake of simplicity, current implementation uses firebase project for both frontend and backend.

Before deploying, there is always this pesky thing of configuring your backend environment with all the private keys... 
(That is where the Environment section above is coming in)

 * We might want to deploy our local working config to the firebase function: `bash build-and-install.sh --set-backend-config`
   this command will **set the current** Environment config file to your firebase function.
   
 * Next we would want to deploy our code: `bash build-and-install.sh --deploy-frontend --deploy-backend`
  **NOTE:** you can run each individually

**NOTE:** If you are locally working with *dev* env, and would like to set *prod* env to your firebase config and deploy, you can do that in one go: 
`bash build-and-install.sh  --set-env=prod --set-backend-config --deploy-frontend --deploy-backend`
   

# More stuff...

For now I am not sure what is missing in terms of the script.. you can run `bash build-and-install.sh --help` to see the full 
capabilities of the script!

The script was designed and tested MOSTLY on MacOS, so guys with Linux forgive me.. and please ping me with issues so I may fix them!!

If you have found a bug or think there is a feature missing, don't be a stranger.. open a ticket.. 
I promise I will take it seriously and try to assist in as soon as possible...

Have a good one... :)
